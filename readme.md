# L2N - Link 2 Notes Chrome Extension
L2N (Link 2 Notes) is a Chrome browser extension created as a learning experience and a useful tool for personal writing. While I typically use Notion for notetaking, I realized that managing everything in markdown files works best for crafting short articles. This realization led me to create L2N.

The current version of the extension is relatively basic, but I have plans to improve it over time. As my knowledge of extension development grows, I will enhance and potentially share it with others.
# Installation

4. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the folder where you cloned/downloaded the extension source code.
5. The L2N extension will be installed, and you will see its icon in the Chrome toolbar.
